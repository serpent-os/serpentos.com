Callout: "These folk wanted you to know they build Serpent OS."

The Core Team is responsible for the every-day running and development of Serpent OS.
Together they coordinate milestones, releases and project goals, and implement them
as required. While each contributor will have a specific domain of interest or expertise,
they share the workload in building the core of Serpent OS.

# Our Loving Community

Most development discussions happen on our matrix channels [#serpentos](https://matrix.to/#/#serpentos:matrix.org) on
matrix.org or in our development channel, [#serpentos-dev](https://matrix.to/#/#serpentos-dev:matrix.org) on matrix.org.

If your matrix client supports spaces (app.element.io does), you can join the
[Serpent OS matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#serpent-os-space:matrix.org ) which will show all the channels offered by
us.

You can also join us at [GitHub(serpent-os)](https://github.com/serpent-os) where you'll find all our code and tools,
[GitHub(snekpit)](https://github.com/snekpit) where you'll find our packaging repositories. 

This is where users contribute and improve Serpent OS.
