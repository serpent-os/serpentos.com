## Aw, shucks

Looks like we haven't released any ISOs yet!

We're working towards the of release a fully functioning and self-hosting Serpent OS core system distributed as a
[systemd-nspawn container](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html).

This container will enable interested parties to start developing Serpent OS packages, 
leveraging our `stone.yml` package recipe format and `boulder` build tooling.

Furthermore, this container will come with support for remote moss index repositories,
which are used for manipulating package selections via our `moss` software lifecycle management tool.

Stay tuned!
