Let's be straight - building an OS from scratch is no small feat 🚀, and our sponsors' support has been instrumental in making this possible. Their backing isn't just about infrastructure costs - it's about enabling us to build something meaningful in the Linux ecosystem.

Your support helps cover our hosting costs and allows us to dedicate more time to making Serpent OS exceptional 🐍. Currently, we're operating through our founder's accounts for infrastructure and development needs, with plans to scale as we grow.

## Notable Sponsors 🏆

A special thanks to [Framework](https://frame.work) for providing us with a Framework 13 DIY Edition laptop - it's been invaluable for development 🔥. Their support has enabled us to ensure excellent hardware compatibility for Framework laptops. The machine has become our primary development platform, and we're genuinely grateful to Framework for their contribution to the project 💪.
