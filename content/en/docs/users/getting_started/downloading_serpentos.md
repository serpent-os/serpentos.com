### Linux

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the ISO file is located along with the checksums.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

2. Run the following command to verify the checksums:

```bash

sha256sum -c <checksum_file>
```
You should see a message indicating that the checksums match if the ISO file is valid.

```bash
serpent-os.iso: OK
```

If the checksums do not match, download the ISO file again and repeat the verification process.

### Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory where the ISO file is located along with the checksums.

```cmd
cd C:\Users\<username>\Downloads
```

2. Run the following command to verify the checksums:

```cmd
certutil -hashfile serpent-os-<version>.iso SHA256
```

This will give you the checksum of the file, compare this to the checksum found inside the checksum file.
